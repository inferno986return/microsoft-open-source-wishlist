# microsoft-open-source-wishlist
A wishlist of Microsoft products I would like open-sourced officially under OSI or FSF approved licensing. These are mostly basic programs pre-installed with Windows.

## Complete
These are projects that Microsoft have released to my knowledge as complete.

* [.NET Framework](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet) – An application development framework, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework#Licensing) most of this is open-sourced.
* [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) – A replacement command-line shell.

## Partial
These are projects that have had some or most of their code released to my knowledge.

* [MS-DOS](https://github.com/Microsoft/MS-DOS) – Microsoft's predecessor to Windows. Both v1.25 and v2.0 have been open-sourced, but ideally I'd like all versions available to be released.

## To-do
These are projects that I would like to see open-sourced that Microsoft to my knowledge own the rights to. Ideally these are the latest versions from Windows 10, but I am happy with Windows 7 versions as an alternative.
